# GAN_mnist_pytorch

The following code contains PyTorch implementation of a simple Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) using the popular MNIST dataset. The final model is able to generate hand written digits that are very close to being real. 


### Final Result

**Simple Linear GAN**

The model was trained for 200 epochs. The images that the generator produced after every epoch is shown in this gif below (the improvementts are clearly visible) -

*The code contains very detailed explaination of the implementation. Although this is a simple Linear Model, a DCGAN (Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network) model will be added to the repository soon!*
